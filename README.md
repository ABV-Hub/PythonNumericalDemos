# PythonNumericalDemos
A collection of Python demos for geostatistical methods.

The demos may include embed functions from GeostatsPy (an effort to wrap/reimplement GSLIB in Python) for convenience.  For the most up-to-date functions it is recommended that you download GeostatsPy.py and place it in the current directory and use the *import GeostatsPy* command instead of including the functions.  GeostatsPy is located in the GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy repository.
